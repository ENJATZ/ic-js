# Svelte

To illustrate the changes needed for the nns code to work with svelte, we have here two projects:

- A vanilla svelte typescript project, created per the docs with:
```
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-starter-project
cd svelte-starter-project
```

- The vanilla project adapted to work with the nns.
